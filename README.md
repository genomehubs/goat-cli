# GoaT CLI

A command line interface for GoaT (Genomes on a Tree). GoaT presents metadata for taxa across the tree of life. 

The CLI here builds URLs to query the <b><a href="https://goat.genomehubs.org/api-docs/">Goat API</a></b>. The underlying API is very powerful, but complex. The aim of this CLI is to remove some of the complexity for the end user.

Please consult the <b><a href="https://github.com/genomehubs/goat-cli/wiki">wiki</a></b> for more information, tutorials, and examples.

## Misc

This CLI is actively being built so no guarantees are made for stability or bugs.

Please test `goat`. Please try and break `goat`. Please find bugs and tell me. Please send feature requests. Creating an issue in this repo is probably the best way to go!
